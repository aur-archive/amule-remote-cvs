"1. I assume the equivalent disable / enable flags are not used anymore too?"
This is correct, just check ./configure --help

"2. If --enable-remote is not used too, what happens to remote support -> aka web interface -> of amule?"
Remote support (aka EC) is always build.

"Of course, any further suggestions how to build the following package:"
There are some deprecated and unnecessary (because enabled by default) flags to configure, but it looks good otherwise. Check the output of ./configure --help to see the default values of the flags.
